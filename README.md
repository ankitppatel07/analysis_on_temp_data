# Exploratory Analysis on Temperature Data

Description:
- Analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
- Calculated moving averages of temperature data rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines when plotting a line graph, making trends more observable.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel
